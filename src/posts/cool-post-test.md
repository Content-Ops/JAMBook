[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) began with its first edit on 15 January 2001, two days after the domain was registered[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia#cite_note-2) by [Jimmy Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales) and [Larry Sanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sanger). Its technological and conceptual underpinnings predate this; the earliest known proposal for an online encyclopedia was made by [Rick Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Gates_(Internet_pioneer)) in 1993,[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia#cite_note-listserv.uh.edu-3) and the concept of a [free-as-in-freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_as_in_freedom) online encyclopedia (as [distinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software) from mere [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model))[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia#cite_note-4) was proposed by [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) in December 2000.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia#cite_note-stallmanencyclopedia-5)

Crucially, Stallman's concept specifically included the idea that no central organization should control editing. This characteristic greatly contrasted with contemporary digital encyclopedias such as [Microsoft Encarta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encarta), [_Encyclopædia Britannica_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica), and even [Bomis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomis)'s [Nupedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nupedia), which was Wikipedia's direct predecessor. In 2001, the license for Nupedia was changed to [GFDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFDL), and Wales and Sanger launched Wikipedia using the concept and technology of a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) pioneered in 1995 by [Ward Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia#cite_note-6) Initially, Wikipedia was intended to complement Nupedia, an online encyclopedia project edited solely by experts, by providing additional draft articles and ideas for it. In practice, Wikipedia quickly overtook Nupedia, becoming a global project in multiple languages and inspiring a wide range of [other online reference projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wikis).

Wikipedia's worldwide monthly readership is approximately 495 million.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia#cite_note-EconWikiPeaks-7) Worldwide in September 2018, WMF Labs tallied 15.5 billion page views for the month.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia#cite_note-8) According to [comScore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ComScore), Wikipedia receives over 117 million monthly unique visitors from the United States alone.
